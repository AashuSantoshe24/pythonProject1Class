#OOPs : Object oriented programming

#Object

#procedural PL - Functions - It doesn't take care about attribute and behaviour
#Just create function and do the task
# C, Basic, Fortan language is an eg of procedural PL

#now, we need something realted to close to world
#OOPs - Class and Objects
#Students - Attributes, Behaviour
#Python, jave , C#, C ++

#OOPs is a programming paradigm that uses "Objects" to design application ans computer programs

#Srudens -->
#Attribute / Properties / Data variables
#Behaviour / Method / Members functions
#Py ATB

#Attribute : Name , id, phone no, gender, color_eyes, city, location, address by which you recognize

#Behaviour : walk, talk, write, sing dance, watch, listen, sleep, cry, smile

#Class and Object
#Class : Class is a group of objects
#Suppose , hypethetically, we are starting a new universe : Here suppose we have given a blueprint to create a human
# Human A : it has different attributes 1. 2 eyes, 2. nose, lips, phone no, name , id 3. address, etc
#It will have a behaviour like walk talk sleep
#now with the blueprint , you have created a human naming Pramod : 2 blacj eyes, nose, address and can walk() at 15 km/p Talk() 4 hours per day , sleep() 10 hour
# also craeted a human name Amit : 2 black eyes, nose , address and can walk() at 15 km/p Talk() 2 hours per day , sleep() 10 hour

#when class is created no memory is allocated, while when object is created then seperate memory is allocated for each object
